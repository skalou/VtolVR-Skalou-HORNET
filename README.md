# VtolVR-Skalou-HORNET
Skalou mods for VtolVR

# Visit the [VTOL FORMATIONS Discord](https://discord.gg/8wzk3NcZ "VTOL FORMATIONS Discord link")

----------------------------

## Installation

- Download and install [UABEAvalonia](https://github.com/nesrak1/UABEA)
- Save the original files that will be modified in VtolVR:
 Inside the  VtolVR game install repository:
...\Steam\steamapps\common\VTOL VR\VTOLVR_Data
	- save the file: "resources.assets" in a safe place.
If you mess with it, you can just delete it and verify the game install with the steam tool. [verify the game install with the steam tool.](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB)
- Just in case, your saved profile should be in %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Boundless Dynamics, LLC\VTOLVR\SaveData, you can save it too if worried, but we won't touch it.

### Replace the needed files with UABEAvalonia:

-Copy/Paste the original "resources.assets" in a working folder and rename into "resources-ORIGINAL.assets"

- Launch the program UABEAvalonia.exe
- File>Open , find the previously copied file "resources-ORIGINAL.assets"
- File>Open , find the file "resources.assets" in your VTOLVR install ( probably ...\Steam\steamapps\common\VTOL VR\VTOLVR_Data)
- In the new opened windows "Asset Info" View>Filter, Deselect All, check "Texture2D"
- Search for the texture to be replaced: (clic on the name column for alphabetical ordering for your mental health)
	- for the bobblehead: tex_bobbleHead
	- for the gloves: tex_newglove
	- etc...	
- Clic on the needed texture to be replaced, then clic "Plugins/Edit Texture/OK"
- On the new opened window, clic "Load", find the corresponding moded texture ("tex_bobbleHead-Hornets-XX.png" etc...) in the previously downloaded and unzipped folder (are you organized?)
- Clic Save, it should close the texture "Edit windows"
- Save: in the "Asset Windows" (not the UABE" windows) : File>Save As... (resources-HornetXX.assets if you are not inspired)
- Export the newly created file to the VtolVR install (inside ...\VTOL VR\VTOLVR_Data)
- Delete the original "resources.assets"
- Rename your newly imported "resources-HornetXX.assets" into "resources.assets"
- So finally, if done correctly there is only 1 "resources.assets" file with our moddified textures in it.
- You can launch the game, enjoy, and send us a picture on the [VTOL FORMATIONS Discord](https://discord.gg/8wzk3NcZ "VTOL FORMATIONS Discord link")
